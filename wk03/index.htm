    <br><br> this chapter will cover: File System Basics, Standard Commands, File Properties, File Permissions.
    <p>
        <b>File System</b> - hierarchical namespace containing the directories and files on your computer. includes all system drives where files are stored.
        <br>includes HD, external drives, USB, and DVD drives.
        <br><br>C: is normally the OS hard disk. A: and B: are rarely used any longer because they are associated with the floppy drives of yore.
        <br> the <b>top level directory</b> is identified with a backslash '\' ex: top level directory of C drive is C:\.
        <br>Any directory created inside the top level directory is a child or subdirectory of ie: C:\, the child directories of a child is also a subdirectory.
        <br> Files are then stored in the directories which creates the orginization system for file storage.
        <br><br>'.' = current directory; '..' = parent directory
    </p>
    <p>
        <ul> Common CLI commands that are PowerShell aliases
            <li><b>cd</b> - change directory - Set-Location</li>
            <li><b>copy</b> - copy a file - = cp - Copy-Item</li>
            <li><b>del</b> - delete a file or directory - Remove-Item</li>
            <li><b>dir</b> - directory listing [does the same as 'ls'] - Get-ChildItem</li>
            <li><b>mkdir</b> - make a new directory</li>
            <li><b>move</b> - move a file - = mv - Move-Item</li>
            <li><b>ren</b> - rename a file - Rename-Item</li>
            <li><b>rmdir</b> - remove a directory</li>
            <li><b>cat</b> - Get-Content</li>
            <li><b>gp</b> - Get-ItemProperty</li>
            <li><b>pwd</b> - Get-Location</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        change the current drive by: entering "cd d:" -- also you could simply enter "d:"" at the prompt to change the current drive.
        <br><br> to move a file and rename at the same time: "move file1.txt C:\dir2\file2.txt" -- renames the file while it moves the file.
    </p>
    <h2> File Properties</h2>
    when you ls or dir the output lists all of the files and directories in the current directory.
    <br> this ouptut contains 4 properties: <b>Mode, Last Write Time, Length, and Name</b>
    <br><br> files and directories have many more properties that are NOT listed by the dir command.
    <br> -- to get all the properties of a file or directory:
    <br> "get-item filename | select *" or "dir | select *" -- the 2nd will display of every file in the directory. get-item * | select * does the exact same thing
    <br><br>select certain properties to display: dir | select name, length, attributes
    <br><br> file permissions define the access rights that user's have when accessing the files and directories.
    <br> the 'Get-Acl' command is used to get limited file permissions: <b><i>get-acl filename</i></b>
    <br> to get the full permissions type: <b><i>get-acl filename | select *</i></b>
    <br><br> the most important permissions we will concentrate on are: <b>AccessToString, Owner, and Group</b>
    <br> AccessToString displays what control you have over a file
    <br><br> ACL stands for Access Control Log.

    <h3>exercise 2</h3>
    <p>-- use New-Item to create a file in PowerShell
        <br><br> ex: <b><i>New-Item "C:\files\open\file.txt" -ItemType File -Value "The first sentence in our file."
        <br>Add-Content "C:\files\open\file.txt" "The second sentence in our file."</i></b>
        <br> <br>these commands would create a text file with some text and then add an additional line of text to the file.
        <br><br> set-content - replaces the original content and overwrites with the new content which is being set
    </p>
