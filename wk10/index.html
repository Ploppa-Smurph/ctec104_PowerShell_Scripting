    <br><br> standard format for iteration in PowerShell:
    <br><b> cmd | where { cmp} | foreach-object { operation }
<br> the cmd retrieves an array of objects; the where-object performs the specified comparison to narrow the array of objects to a specified set; the foreach-object command iterates through the array of objects one at the time and performs the specified operation using the object
<br> the Foreach-object command performs the iteration through the array of input
<br> the commands and operations will run once for each object of input; you can place as many commands as you like in the curly braces; separate multiple commands by ';'
<br><br> ex: <b>get-service | where {$_.DisplayName -like "Remote*"} | foreach-object {$_.DisplayName}</b>
    <br> in this example Get-Service retrieves system services and stores them in an array of Service Objects
    <br>Where-Object then narrows this array to just the service whose Display Name begins with "Remote"
    <br>Foreach-Object then displays the Display Name for each service
    <br><br> example with math operations:
    <br><b>$n = 0</b>
    <br><b>get-process | where {$_.SI -eq 2} | foreach-object {$n += $_.NPM + $_.PM}</b>
    <br>$n
    <br> this example creates a variable $n set to 0; we then Get the Process for Session ID (SI)
    <2 in my case>; the Foreach-object adds all the memory space being used by the processes; $n then contains the total memory usage in kilobytes for this session
        <br>the result is 2.47GB of memory on my system
        <br><br>sometimes the Where-Object / Where is not necessary in iteration
        <br>ex: <b>get-childitem b* | foreach-object {cmd}</b>
        <br>this did something with strange to my computer.
