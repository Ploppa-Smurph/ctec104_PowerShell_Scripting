Iterating Exercise
------------------

1. In the C:\Windows\System32 directory get all of the files with a .exe extension and a length greater than 1MB.
   Use Foreach-object to display the Name and CreationTime for the files.
   What is the command to perform this operation?

get-childitem  | Where-Object {$_.Name -Like "*.exe" -and $_.Length -gt 1MB} | foreach-object {$_.Name; $_.CreationTime}

2. Get all of the svchost processes.
   Use Foreach-object to display the Id and Modules for each process.

	a. What is the command to perform this operation?

Get-Process svchost | ForEach-Object {$_.Id; $_.Modules}

	b. How can this output be used for system security scanning?

You can see the processID and associated modules running for each process; you can also see where the modules are stored. That way you can trace any suspect process back to it’s location

3. Use foreach-object to extract specific information from the registry.
   Find all of the sub-keys of HKCU:\ used by Excel and display only the key names.

	a. What is the command to perform this operation?



	b. Find all of the sub-keys of HKCU:\ used by Excel and store them in a variable. Using this variable,for the command: $var | foreach-object { $_.name; get-itemproperty $_.PSPath }
	   What will the output be?



	c. Perform the commands for b and review the output. What obvious problem do you see?



	d. What conclusion can be drawn from this?
