    <br> types of variables, using variables, arrays
    <h3>Variables</h3>variables store values. The data stored by variables can be different types.
    <br> In PowerShell variables can be single objects or arrays of objects.
    <br><br> <b>Variables</b> can be created by the user of the system
    <br>variable names always start with '$' in PowerShell. Variables are NOT Case Sensitive in PowerShell.
    <br><br> ex: <b>$my_var</b>
    <h4>4 types of variables</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>User Created</b></li> temporary variables that disappear when PowerShell closes
        <li><b>Automatic</b></li> system created variables that store the state of PowerShell, cannot modify these variables
        <li><b>Preference</b></li> store user preferences, populated by PowerShell and modified by the user
        <li><b>Environment</b></li> similar to preference variables, but store information about the operating system which can be modified.
    </ul>
    <br> User Created, Automatic, and Preference variables are stored in the variable drive.
    <br> <b>get-childitem variable:</b> to view them in your system
    <br><br>Environmental variables are stored in the Env drive, to view them:
    <br><b>get-childitem env:</b>
    <h2>Types of Variables</h2>
    <h4>Automatic Variables</h4>
    <b>$HOME</b> - personal directory for user account
    <br><b>$PROFILE</b> - directory and file identifies your user profile
    <br>you can store aliases and other personal variables in the file. they are available in the PowerShell window
    <br><b>$PWD</b> your current working directory
    <h4>Environmental Variables</h4>
    <b>$Env:Path</b> - long list of directories, locations where PowerShell search for executables
    <br><b>$Env:PSModulePath</b> contains a list of directories. PowerShell modules are stored.
    <br> One of the directories is inside your user account. this is where we store our personal modules that we create
    <h4>Help for Variables</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>get-help about_Automatic_Variables</li>
        <li>get-help about_Preference_Variables</li>
        <li>get-help about_Environment_Variables</li>
        <li>get-help about_Profiles</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Using Variables</h2>
    mostly used to store the output of a command
    <br>use this format: <b>$var = cmd</b>
    <br> the command will run and store it's output in $var instead of displaying in the window.
    <br> the variable can store the result of complex pipelined commands, eg:
    <br><b>$var = cmd | cmd | cmd</b> -- the output of the final command is stored in the instance
    <br><br> to view the contents of a variable simply type the variable name. ex: $var
    <br><br> Variables store PowerShell objects so they have a full set of properties and methods
    <br><b>$var | get-member</b>- to see variables object type and method
    <br><b>$var | select *</b> - see the variables full properties type
    <br><br><b>$d = get-date</b> sets the variable $d to the command get-date, so when you <b>$d | get-member</b>
    <br> the get-member cmd will show that $d contains a DateTime object.
    <br><b>$d | select *</b> the select command will display the properties of $d
    <h2>Arrays</h2>
    many times the output will be several objects, in those instances the variable holds and Array.
    <br>an <b>Array</b> is a set of multiple items that are all of the same object. Object Arrays are useful input into many PowerShell commands
    <br><br><b>$sv = get-process svchost</b>
    <br><b>$sv | get-member</b>
    <br> output of get-member command shows that $sv is store 'Process' objects. get-member also displays all the methods $sv can use
    <br><b>$sv</b> will list the full list of objects
    <br><br><b>ToString()</b> $sv.ToString(); the output is 'System.Object[]' -- the brackets indicate the object is an array
    <br><br><b>$d = get-date</b>
    <br><b>$d.ToString()</b>
    <br> $d is a single object & ToString displays the contents of the object -- this is a quick easy way to identify object arrays.
    <br> to she the number of objects in the array: <b>$d.Count</b>
    <br> In scripting we will learn about commands than can be used to iterate through the objects in an array
