Functions Exrecise
------------------

1. Consider the following function:

 1	function get-afiles {
 2	   [CmdletBinding()]
 3	   param(
 4	      [parameter(Mandatory=$true,
 5	      ValueFromPipeline=$true)]
 6	      $af
 7	   )
 8	   process {
 9	      $a = $af | Where {$_.mode -like "*a*"}
10	      write-output $a
11	   }
12	}

	a. What does the second line of this function definition do?

	b. What are the requirements for the function's parameter?

	c. What does this function do?

	d. What types of commands should be used for pipelining input to this command?

	e. What types of commands can receive the output of this command in the pipeline?

2. Lookup the online help for PowerShell functions.

	a. What is the purpose of the begin block?

	b. What is the purpose of the process block?

	c. What is the purpose of the end block?

	d. What happens if none of the blocks are defined?

3. The function example in Question 1 showed one method for accessing parameters from the pipeline.

	a. Do pipelined parameters have to be defined in the param block?

	b. What other approach can be used to access pipelined parameters?

4. When you write a function, where should you place it in order to have access to it?

5. What are the essential differences between a function and a script?
